      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Every writer has a story inside of them, but sometimes they're unable to
        express that story in the ideal ways they have in their heads. That's
        why I want to create a website where publishing your short story is fun,
        easy, and professional. Wouldn't it be cool to be able to not only
        upload a short story you've written, but also illustrations and
        music/ambiance to go along with it? You can truly engage your audience
        with your work as they have these additions in mind.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The truth is, there's no age limit for creativity. Anyone that can have
        access to a computer or smart phone should easily be able to share their
        short stories online through Story Hollow, just as long as they're
        respectful, professional, and considerate of others. We also encourage
        users to not share stories of graphic or adult nature without a rating
        tag. That way, once readers go online, they'll know what kind of story
        they'll be in for.
      </p>

        Typography
      </h3>
      <h4 class="font-1">
        Heading Font: Obidee Sans
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font has a very neutral tone to it. It could be used for fantasy,
        sci-fi, mystery, horror, slice of life, etc. This also embodies the
        essence of what this site is about: Simple, yet versitile.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-2">
        Paragraph Font: Open Sans Condensed
      </h4>
      <p>
        This is a very simple paragraph text that is easily readable, while also
        interesting enough to keep reading.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
        happen for you.

        The Basics
      </h4>
      <p>
        Storyhollow is a website that showcases your writing in new and
        experimentive ways. There are countless storytellers out there that have
        their tales written down, but they don’t quite know how to share it with
        the world. Of course, there are websites like Wattpad, AOL or
        Fanfiction.net, but those websites, especially Fanfiction.net, are
        usually used for, well, fanfiction. At storyhollow.com, we encourage
        users to write their own stories, with their own world-building and
        their own narratives and characters. We also encourage users to search
        for new stories and get inspired by the stories other people tell.
      </p>
      <h4>
        General
      </h4>
      <p>
        In terms of website design, Storyhollow will be like Tumblr, or
        Pinterest, where users have the freedom to make and link their own
        sub-blogs. If users want the full experience of Storyhollow, they’ll
        need to sign up for a Storyhollow account. Users can also easily search
        for usernames, or story titles in the search bar on the homepage.
        Finally, users can discover new content on the discovery page, where
        they’ll be able to search for new stories to read under genre tags. In
        these discover pages, the user will be shown the most popular stories as
        of right now. They could be short stories, or new chapters of a larger
        novel that come out weekly. When a user is recommended a story, they’ll
        usually be redirected to the beginning of the story, so that they can
        start fresh.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>The Story Layout</h3>
      <p>
        When a user clicks on a story, they’ll be directed to the beginning of
        the story. The author of the story has the option to add pictures,
        ambient background music, color themes and fonts. This can allow for
        some truly creative investment coming from the user reading the story.
        The user also has the option to like and share the story, and subscribe
        to the author for more content. The author will be required to add genre
        and trigger warning tags so the reader knows what kind of story they’re
        in for. If the user feels as though the author gave a false tag, they
        can report the author, and depending on the severity of the false tag,
        the author could be forced to take their story down, or even permanently
        banned from Storyhollow. (Idea: before publishing their story, the
        author could be required to fill out a questionnaire about their story
        so that they’ll know the appropriate tags to add to it.)
      </p>
      <h4>
        Pictures
      </h4>
      <p>
        Pictures may add a bit of a visual element to a story. The limit will be
        1 picture per 1,000 words. (Please keep in mind, this isn’t
        conventionally a webcomic platform, although if the website gets popular
        enough, we could introduce tags specifically for webcomics.) These
        pictures could be public domain photos, photography or even drawings
        that the author made themselves! Feel free to be creative!
      </p>
      <h4>
        Music
      </h4>
      <p>
        Authors are allowed to add some sort of continuous music track that goes
        along well with their story. Music can add a whole other layer of
        complexity to a story if executed well. Keep in mind, certain music can
        be more distracting than inviting, so make sure you choose your music
        wisely. If you do choose to add a music track, you will need to make
        sure it’s royalty free, or even music that you produced yourself.

      </ul>
      <h3>Author's Page</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, this page will detail general information about the author.
        Please keep in mind, literally anyone could visit this site, so make
        sure you only share information you feel comfortable with strangers
        knowing, like your username, hobbies, favorite genres, past works, etc.
        It would not be wise to share revealing information about yourself. Be
        smart. Be safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your author's page will showcase all of the works that you've published
        onto Storyhollow. Through your author's page, people can search for a
        specific story. Make sure you update often so that you can have a large
        audience!
